Project for [HackRice](https://hack.rice.edu/) 12, where I was on a team with Daniel Li, Bryce Liu, and Ethan Peck; we competed in the Safety and Security track and Data Science challenge. Motivated by a string of laptop thefts at our residential college prior to the hackathon, we were inspired to create a website that could help students make informed decisions regarding their safety and personal belongings. To that end, we decided to create an interactive heatmap with data scraped from the [RUPD crime log](https://rupdadmin.rice.edu/crimelog/unskinned/), with filters available for various time ranges, locations, and classifications of incidents, as well as infographics to further contextualize the frequency of specific types of crimes in relation to others.

We ended up using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for the backend and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for the frontend, integrated with [Google Maps's JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) to generate the actual heat map (which was what I primarily contributed to, as I had little web development experience at the time). We also used Python's built-in request library for web scraping and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for cleaning and analyzing the data.
