I was a member of the 2023 [Open Source Accelerator](https://subdued-chevre-19d.notion.site/OSA-2023-32a77ab86f8047b2b9e376f60bb36c9b) (OSA) cohort, [RiceApps](https://riceapps.org/)'s annual web/app development summer program for beginners. The first part of the program consisted of a 4-week bootcamp period in which we covered HTML/CSS/React for frontend and MongoDB/Express/GraphQL for backend; for the remaining 5 weeks, I was assigned to a 9-person team where we built [Owl Mart](https://github.com/rice-apps/owlmart), a full-stack marketplace web app for Rice students to buy and sell items, from scratch. I helped implement the landing/home pages with React, primarily using the Material UI library for the UI components, and more importantly gained a lot of experience working and coordinating software development with a team.
