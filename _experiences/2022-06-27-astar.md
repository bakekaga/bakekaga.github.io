Over the summer of 2022, I taught 60+ total students advanced topics in algebra, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory at two of AlphaStar Academy's annual summer math camps. I also helped prepare educational materials (video solutions, interactive activities, lecture notes/slides) for future camps and classes.
