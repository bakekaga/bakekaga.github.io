		Hi! I'm Albert, a student at Rice University dual majoring in computer science/mathematics and minoring in data science. My interests in computer science lie in machine learning, bioinformatics, and software engineering, but I'm also passionate about applying my technical knowledge to social issues, particularly in the realms of education and healthcare. In my free time, I enjoy playing table tennis, reading, and playing board/word games.
