In April of 2023, I was accepted as a member of the 2023 [HackRice](https://hack.rice.edu/) board, where I was part of the Tracks & Workshops committee along with Richard Gao; the hackathon ended up having over 400 registered participants. Our duties included choosing and designing prompts for the hackers; familiarizing ourselves with the Discord API and writing starter code for the First-Timers' Track; and organizing logistics for 6 workshops held before and throughout the hackathon.
