During the summer of 2023, I joined [OptimaLab](https://akyrillidis.github.io/) under Dr. Tasos Kyrillidis for a maching learning REU. My project with [Jasper Liao](https://jasperliao.github.io/) consisted of investigating novel methods for solving large-scale linear systems distributively, following the [IST](https://akyrillidis.github.io/ist/) paradigm. I ran experiments in Jupyter Notebook, where we tested various approaches for step-size scheduling on local workers.
