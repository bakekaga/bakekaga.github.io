I was one of 94 invitees to Jane Street's annual [First-Year Trading and Technology Program](https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/programs-and-events/fttp/). Over the course of four days, I learned about finance concepts like market-making, ETFs, and options through talks and desk visits. I also participated in various market simulation games, and on the final day, we were divided into 3-person teams for an Electronic Trading Competition, in which my team's Python bot achieved the highest PnL of the field across 60+ simulated market rounds.
